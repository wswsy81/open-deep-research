</div>

A powerful open-source research assistant that generates comprehensive AI-powered reports from web search results. Unlike other Deep Research solutions, it provides seamless integration with multiple AI platforms including Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and even local models - giving you the freedom to choose the perfect AI model for your specific research requirements.

This app functions in three key steps:

1. **Search Results Retrieval**: Using either Google Custom Search or Bing Search API (configurable), the app fetches comprehensive search results for the specified search term.
2. **Content Extraction**: Leveraging JinaAI, it retrieves and processes the contents of the selected search results, ensuring accurate and relevant information.
3. **Report Generation**: With the curated search results and extracted content, the app generates a detailed report using your chosen AI model (Gemini, GPT-4, Sonnet, etc.), providing insightful and synthesized output tailored to your custom prompts.
4. **Knowledge Base**: Save and access your generated reports in a personal knowledge base for future reference and easy retrieval.

Open Deep Research combines powerful tools to streamline research and report creation in a user-friendly, open-source platform. You can customize the app to your needs (select your preferred search provider, AI model, customize prompts, update rate limits, and configure the number of results both fetched and selected).

## Configuration

The app's settings can be customized through the configuration file at `lib/config.ts`. Here are the key parameters you can adjust:

### Rate Limits

Control rate limiting and the number of requests allowed per minute for different operations:

```typescript
rateLimits: {
  enabled: true,         // Enable/disable rate limiting (set to false to skip Redis setup)
  search: 5,            // Search requests per minute
  contentFetch: 20,     // Content fetch requests per minute
  reportGeneration: 5,  // Report generation requests per minute
}
```

Note: If you set `enabled: false`, you can run the application without setting up Redis. This is useful for local development or when you don't need rate limiting.

### Search Provider Configuration

The app supports both Google Custom Search and Bing Search APIs. You can configure your preferred search provider in `lib/config.ts`:

```typescript
search: {
  resultsPerPage: 10,
  maxSelectableResults: 3,
  provider: 'google', // 'google' or 'bing'
  safeSearch: {
    google: 'active',  // 'active' or 'off'
    bing: 'moderate'   // 'moderate', 'strict', or 'off'
  },
  market: 'en-US',
}
```

To use Google Custom Search:

1. Get your API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a Custom Search Engine and get your CX ID from [Google Programmable Search](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)
3. Add the credentials to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
GOOGLE_SEARCH_CX="your-cx-id"
```

To use Bing Search:

1. Get your API key from [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Add the credential to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
AZURE_SUB_KEY="your-azure-key"
```

### Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base feature allows you to build a personal research library by:

- Saving generated reports with their original search queries
- Accessing and loading past reports instantly
- Building a searchable archive of your research
- Maintaining context across research sessions

Reports saved to the Knowledge Base include:

- The full report content with all sections
- Original search query and prompt
- Source URLs and references
- Generation timestamp

You can access your Knowledge Base through the dedicated button in the UI, which opens a sidebar containing all your saved reports.

### AI Platform Settings

Configure which AI platforms and models are available. The app supports multiple AI platforms (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek) with various models for each platform. You can enable/disable platforms and individual models based on your needs:

```typescript
platforms: {
  google: {
    enabled: true,
    models: {
      'gemini-flash': {
        enabled: true,
        label: 'Gemini Flash',
      },
      'gemini-flash-thinking': {
        enabled: true,
        label: 'Gemini Flash Thinking',
      },
      'gemini-exp': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'Gemini Exp',
      },
    },
  },
  openai: {
    enabled: true,
    models: {
      'gpt-4o': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'GPT-4o',
      },
      'o1-mini': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'o1-mini',
      },
      'o1': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'o1',
      },
    },
  },
  anthropic: {
    enabled: true,
    models: {
      'sonnet-3.5': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'Claude 3 Sonnet',
      },
      'haiku-3.5': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'Claude 3 Haiku',
      },
    },
  },
  deepseek: {
    enabled: true,
    models: {
      'chat': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'DeepSeek V3',
      },
      'reasoner': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'DeepSeek R1',
      },
    },
  },
  openrouter: {
    enabled: true,
    models: {
      'auto': {
        enabled: false,
        label: 'OpenRouter (Auto)',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

For each platform:

- `enabled`: Controls whether the platform is available
- For each model:
  - `enabled`: Controls whether the specific model is selectable
  - `label`: The display name shown in the UI

Disabled models will appear grayed out in the UI but remain visible to show all available options. This allows users to see the full range of available models while clearly indicating which ones are currently accessible.

To modify these settings, update the values in `lib/config.ts`. The changes will take effect after restarting the development server.

### OpenRouter Integration

OpenRouter provides access to various AI models through a unified API. By default, it's set to 'auto' mode which automatically selects the most suitable model, but you can configure it to use specific models of your choice by modifying the models section in the configuration.

### Important Note for Reasoning Models

When using advanced reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 or DeepSeek Reasoner, you may need to increase the serverless function duration limit as these models typically take longer to generate comprehensive reports. The default duration might not be sufficient.

For Vercel deployments, you can increase the duration limit in your `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/report/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 120
    }
  }
}
```

Or modify the duration in your route file:

```typescript
// In app/api/report/route.ts
export const maxDuration = 120 // Set to 120 seconds or higher
```

Note: The maximum duration limit may vary based on your hosting platform and subscription tier.

### Local Models with Ollama

The app supports local model inference through Ollama integration. You can:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) on your machine
2. Pull your preferred models using `ollama pull model-name`
3. Configure the model in `lib/config.ts`:

```typescript
platforms: {
  ollama: {
    enabled: true,
    models: {
      'your-model-name': {
        enabled: true,
        label: 'Your Model Display Name'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Local models through Ollama bypass rate limiting since they run on your machine. This makes them perfect for development, testing, or when you need unlimited generations.
